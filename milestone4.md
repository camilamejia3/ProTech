TESTING PHASE: TASK BREADDOWN 

Linibeth Mejia:
- Modify the code that generates the product cards within the product grid section to loop through the filtered product data instead 
of the complete product data.
- Update the HTML markup within the loop to display the filtered product information correctly.
- Implement the categories menu and ensure it integrates well with the rest of the shop page layout. Apply any necessary CSS changes to
style the shop page.
