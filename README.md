# ProTech
we would be developing a third-party website that aggregates and displays product information and reviews, focusing specifically on technology products.
The primary goal of the project is to help users make informed purchasing decisions by providing a platform where they can search for products, read detailed product descriptions, 
and read reviews. 
In addition, the website will include secure user registration and authentication, allowing users to create accounts and gain access to additional features such as reviewing products
of interest and saving them. The implementation of filters, keywords, or categories will also be essential for users to efficiently find products that meet their specific needs.
